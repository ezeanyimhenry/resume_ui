# resume_ui

A mobile app version of my Resume.

## Description

This project was done with Flutter & Dart. It shows a UI of my Resume (About me, Social links, Skills, What I offer).

It has Multiple Language Translator and Dark/Light mode switch.

Design Inspiration from: [Resume UI Design](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/462604192971991059/)


Libraries Used:

- Google Fonts: Used for the texts fonts and styling on the app
- URL Launcher: Used to embed social links
- Font Awesome Fluter: Used for the icons in the app
- Language Builder: Used to implement the language translator
- Responsive UI Container: used for App responsiveness and behaviour on different screens

Other Features I would like to add:
- A Projects Portfolio Slider with links to view project.
- GitHub Api Integration to view repositories.

Challenges Faced

- I had issues with state management when implementing the dark/light mode feature
- I had issues with null safety after implementing the language translator. (The App was running on macOS but not iOS)
